# Sudoku Solver

For [UKPA Hybrid Sudoku Contest](https://ukpuzzles.org/contests.php?contestid=56) problem 6: Little Killer and Even.

I'm trying to find all solutions via brute force + backtracking, and compare the speed using normal Python and Cython.

```
Time Python:                          878.19s
Time Cython:                          521.93s
Time Cython (some additional typing): 417.01s
Time Cython (some more typing):       373.33s
```
